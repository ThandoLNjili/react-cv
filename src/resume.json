      "summary": "I am currently working as a Front End Developer on a small React team building Insurance applications and I am across multiple applications that have been developed using our new technology stack. IAG are keen to utilise the latest technologies and we have had great success using React/Redux running on a Node Express server and using an API backend architecture (via APIGEE) to access the various IAG systems. I have also been a key part of a team developing an in-house Design System called Chroma, this is a platform and framework agnostic component library. We have then built a React component library on top of this system which is used for all IAG Customer Labs applications. As part of this team I have also been responsible for setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Github/CircleCI/Heroku/NPM & AWS.",
